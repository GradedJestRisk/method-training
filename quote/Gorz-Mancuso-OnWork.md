From Clean Agile, 2019
Craftmanship promotes software development as a profession. 
There is a difference between having a job and having a profession. 
A job is a thing we do but it is not a part of who we are. 
A profession, on the other hand, is part of who we are. 
When asked, "What do you do?", a person with a job would normally say something like "I work for company X",
or " I work as a software developer." 
But a person with a profession would generally say, "I am a software developer". 
A profession is something we invest in. 
It's something we want to get better at. 
We want to gain some skills and have a long-lasting and fulfilling career.
